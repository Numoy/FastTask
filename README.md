Hello everyone. Greetings from Germany :).

This is my application for the flutter_create contest.
My name is Marvin MÃ¤rz and i have created a todo-app for this contest.
First of all i wanted to thank you for the awesome framework you have created.

The application should be runnable on IOS and Android (Its only tested on Android).

My Idea:
I wanted to create a simple but really effective todo-app. The basic idea is that you can create
an entry only by 15 characters. Every entry has a color which represents its importance (It can be changed
by clicking on the card).
If you have finished your task you can swipe it to the right and it is dismissed.


Thank your for reading and trying out my app. If you have any further questions send an email to
marvin.maerz@gmail.com

Have a nice day.
